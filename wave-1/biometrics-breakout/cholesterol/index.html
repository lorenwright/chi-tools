                    <h2>Cholesterol</h2>
                    <p>High levels of this soft, waxy substance in the bloodstream and body’s cells increase the risk for heart disease or stroke. To determine how your cholesterol levels affect your risk of heart disease, your doctor will also take into account other risk factors such as age, family history, smoking and high blood pressure.</p>
                    <p><strong>Total Cholesterol</strong> – A total cholesterol reading of more than 200 mg/dL may put you at an increased risk for coronary heart disease.</p>
                    <p><strong>LDL Cholesterol</strong> – This is referred to as “bad” cholesterol. Lower levels of LDL cholesterol generally represent a lower risk for heart attack and stroke. Levels below 100 are considered ideal.</p>
                    <p><strong>HDL Cholesterol</strong> – This is the “good” cholesterol.  Higher levels of HDL are thought to protect against heart attacks. Levels above 60 are preferred. Genetic factors, type 2 diabetes, smoking, being overweight and being sedentary can all result in lower HDL cholesterol.</p>
                    <p><strong>Triglyceride Levels</strong> – While fat in the blood provides energy to your body, excess fat can build up in your artery walls and increase your risk for heart disease and stroke. Levels below 150 are desirable.</p>
