                        <p>A biometric screening is a great first step to understanding your numbers and the risks to your health. This screening can be conducted by your primary care physician and is an important step in making educated health decisions that impact your future.  <strong>Traditional biometric screenings include:</strong></p>

                        <p>BMI is a calculation based on your weight and height and identifies possible excessive weight problems that might put you at higher risk for serious health issues. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered healthy.</p>

                        <p>Blood pressure is a good indicator of cardiovascular health. A normal blood pressure level is anything less than 120/80. Higher levels indicate your heart is working too hard to pump blood through your body, which increases the risk of heart disease, congestive heart failure and stroke.</p>

While your levels may fluctuate throughout the day, a healthy fasting blood sugar level for non-diabetics is between 70 and 100.

                        <p>High levels of this soft, waxy substance in the bloodstream and body’s cells increase the risk for heart disease or stroke. To determine how your cholesterol levels affect your risk of heart disease, your doctor will also take into account other risk factors such as age, family history, smoking and high blood pressure.</p>
                        <p><strong>Total Cholesterol</strong> – A total cholesterol reading of more than 200 mg/dL may put you at an increased risk for coronary heart disease.</p>
                        <p><strong>LDL Cholesterol</strong> – This is referred to as “bad” cholesterol. Lower levels of LDL cholesterol generally represent a lower risk for heart attack and stroke. Levels below 100 are considered ideal.</p>
                        <p><strong>HDL Cholesterol</strong> – This is the “good” cholesterol.  Higher levels of HDL are thought to protect against heart attacks. Levels above 60 are preferred. Genetic factors, type 2 diabetes, smoking, being overweight and being sedentary can all result in lower HDL cholesterol.</p>
                        <p><strong>Triglyceride Levels</strong> – While fat in the blood provides energy to your body, excess fat can build up in your artery walls and increase your risk for heart disease and stroke. Levels below 150 are desirable.</p>
