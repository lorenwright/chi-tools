                    <p>
                        Regular screening is the best way to prevent colon cancer. Screening detects problems early, when they’re easiest to treat. Talk to your health care provider about which of these screening options are best for you based on your health status and family history.

                    <div class="modal">
                        <p>This procedure requires a day or two of bowel prep involving a special diet and laxatives. The test itself usually lasts about 30 minutes, during which you’re typically sedated. The colon and rectum are examined via a small camera and if polyps are discovered, they’re removed and tested.</p>
                        <p>People at average risk of developing colorectal cancer should get this screening at age 50 and every 10 years thereafter.</p>

                    <div class="modal">
                        <p>This is like a mini-colonoscopy, but requires less bowel prep. It examines the lower part of the colon and rectum, rather than the entire thing. If polyps or other indications of cancer are found, a full colonoscopy will be performed.</p>
                        <p>Your provider may recommend this screening in addition to, or as a replacement for a colonoscopy or as a replacement screening test at age 50 and may repeat every 5 - 10 years thereafter.</p>

                    <div class="modal">
                        <p>Following bowel prep, a liquid called barium is put into the rectum. Air is used to spread it into the colon, where it improves imaging for an X-ray to discover polyps or other signs of cancer. If polyps are found or other indications of cancer are detected, a full colonoscopy will be performed.</p>
                        <p>Your provider may recommend this screening in addition to, or as a replacement for a colonoscopy or as a replacement screening test at age 50 and may repeat every 5 - 10 years thereafter.</p>

                        <p>This screening requires bowel prep, and may include drinking a contrast material before a CT (Computed Tomography) scanner uses X-ray technology to provide detailed cross-sectional images of the colon and rectum. If polyps or other indications of cancer are found, a full colonoscopy will be performed.</p>

                        <p>This test is used to check for specific gene changes that can be found in colon and rectal cancer cells. You receive a kit at home, collect a stool sample and mail it to a lab. The rigorous prep involved in a colonoscopy isn’t needed for this test. However, if possible signs of cancer are detected, a colonoscopy is used to confirm them.</p>
                        <p>Your provider may recommend this test for signs of cancer and may be repeated every 3 years (or year) thereafter.</p>

                        <p>Using a kit and instructions provided by your health care provider, this test is taken at home. The test responds to blood in the stool, which could be a sign of cancer or polyps. If the test detects blood, follow-up testing might include a colonoscopy.</p>
                        <p>Your provider may recommend this test for signs of cancer and may be repeated every year thereafter.</p>

                        <p>Colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, barium enema and CT (X-ray) of the colon are common screens used to detect polyps and cancer for a person with average risk. Whereas, occult stool tests are used to detect cancer and may be used as a follow-up to one of the more common screening options. Stool tests should not be used to replace a colonoscopy or other common screening test.</p>
