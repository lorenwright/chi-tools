                        <p>While lung cancer screening can be a life-saving procedure, it also presents potential risks, including possible false alarms that may lead to unneeded additional testing. There is also the risk of being treated for cancer that likely would have never caused harm. And youâ€™ll be exposed to a small amount of radiation during the LDCT scan. Screening should be a shared decision with your doctor.</p>
